# EyojCollectionProgress

This project was created as a reference to a Medium article focused on demonstrating different methods to achieve similar results without using certain Kotlin Collection extension functions. Specifically, the `eyojointostringcollection` module showcases how to handle string collections efficiently.

## GIF Demonstrations

Here are the various scenarios covered in the project. Each showcases a different method for handling collections in Kotlin:

### FlatMap Usage | Map Usage | Map with Flatten Usage

### forEach Usage | joinToString Usage | Distinct with joinToString Usage
